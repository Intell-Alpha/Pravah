PRAVAH - Platform for Reliable Authentication and Verification of AccreditedÂ Holdings

PRAVAH is a comprehensive automated document verification platform designed to eliminate inefficiencies in manual document verification processes. The platform leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain technology, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to ensure secure, tamper-proof, and efficient verification of documents such as academic transcripts, certificates, and identity documents.

Key Features
- AI-Powered Verification: Automatically verifies document authenticity using advanced AI models.
- OCR Integration: Extracts text from uploaded document images for validation against blockchain hashes.
- Blockchain-Backed: Ensures tamper-proof, immutable records for secure document verification.
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple, intuitive interface for issuing authorities, verifying authorities, and individuals.
- Encryption: Uses XSalsa20 encryption to secure document uploads and storage.
- Real-Time Verification: Provides instant feedback on document authenticity.
- Audit Trails: Maintains logs of all verification activities for transparency and accountability.
- Scalable Architecture: Cloud-based infrastructure (Firebase) to handle high volumes of documents efficiently.
